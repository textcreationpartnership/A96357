            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Here ob≈øerve he taxeth me once to have vi≈øited him in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and there to have given him evill and provoking Language; what my words were he reciteth not, but I ≈øhall; with the rea≈øon why I went to vi≈øit him having formerly ≈øome acquaintance with him, when he was an Apprentice, with a Cloth-Drawer; I then being a Clothier in <hi>Reading</hi> had occa≈øion to have much Cloth pa≈ø≈øe through his Ma≈øters hands, and ≈øome time after hearing of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pri≈øoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> I went to ≈øee him there, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his chamber, I found him writing of a Letter, one ≈øtanding by him to receive it; when he had fini≈øh't, he asked me, if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159878:3"/>I had any thing to him; I told him, I came out of my love to ≈øee him, and de≈øired him for the glory of God,<note place="margin">Fooles de≈øpi≈øe Coun≈øell ≈øaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </note> to carry him≈øelfe humbly, and as one po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing the ≈øpirit, as onely profe≈ø≈øing the Go≈øpell, for if he had a good cau≈øe he would ≈øpoile it in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; here he abruptly asked me, if this were all I came for, and rudely pulling me by the Coat ≈øaid, if I had not beene an old man, he would have throwne me downe Stayrs; his rough ≈øpeeches and ≈øturdy ge≈øtures gave me cau≈øe to feare he would doe as he had ≈øaid; being downe the Stayrs I told him, I had heard much of him, now had ≈øeen, and if warine≈ø≈øe prevented not, ≈øpirituall pride would be his overthrow: which he hearing was coming down the Staires after me, but I fled away and e≈øcaped his hands, and this was all the evill and provoking Language which I then gave him.

               <hi>Lilburne.</hi> And here perhaps ≈øome man may ≈øay (and that truely) that I needed not to have troubled my ≈øelfe, to have put forth an an≈øwer, all men knowing his lying humour, and his frequent ≈ølanders are ≈øuch, that all wi≈øemen count the party ≈øo much the more vertuous, by how much the more he is calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him; but let him be plea≈øed to con≈øider, that although his cau≈øe would have been ≈øo, and no otherwi≈øe looked upon by the truely judicious, yet the vulgar are apt, on the lea≈øt in≈øtigation, to apprehend the lea≈øt accu≈øation tending to the defaming of any in Office, not looking on the cau≈øe of his accu≈øation, nor the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedne≈ø≈øe of the party,<note place="margin">Who hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured his life for the Parliament at Mar≈øton more, and was to be pulled out of the Hou≈øe when the King came for the five members.</note> his accu≈øer. As for in≈øtance, how hath his lies taken impre≈ø≈øion, and eate as a Canker into the honour of the right Noble the Earle of <hi>Manche≈øter,</hi> Col. <hi>King.</hi> &amp;c. Therefore if tho≈øe potent and honourable per≈øons, could not ≈øhake him off without ≈øome dammage, what could I have looked for, if I had ≈øate ≈øtill, and not an≈øwered his fal≈øe accu≈øation.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of one pa≈ø≈øage, which Ma≈øter <hi>Lilburne</hi> hath in a Letter annexed to his Treati≈øe, as if penned by ≈øome other man, entituled, <hi>An excellent Letter, written by a pri≈øoner to a worthy member of the Hou≈øe of Commons,</hi> his words are the≈øe: <hi>O where is Ju≈øtice? may not tho≈øe Royall plunderers as well ju≈øtifie all the Hou≈øe of Peeres, the≈øe impri≈øonments and commitments.</hi> Let the Reader reading this, admire at the unheard of impudence of this man, who ≈øticketh not to compare the Acts of the Lords and Commons a≈ø≈øembled in Parliament to be as illegall, and unju≈øt, ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159878:9"/>and execrable, as the wor≈øt of the Royall party. Marke how <q>this man maketh the Word of God his rule, who commandeth not to ≈øpeake evill of Dignities, muchle≈ø≈øe to affront and vilifie them fal≈øely, and on no ground ≈øave malice; and when they are taxed, or ≈øuffer the lea≈øt for their exorbitancies, cry out, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is broken, and unheard of cruelties are u≈øed, the ≈øubject is en≈ølaved, and brought into Egyptian bondage. And yet the≈øe men, and in particular M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lilburne</hi> would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this is the way that he Word of God alloweth, which if it be, as every good man will acknowledge: how comes it to pa≈ø≈øe that he and his complices tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe therefrom,<note place="margin">He lieth at home every Sabbath if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo good a man do preach.</note> venting their own corrupt doctrine in Hou≈øes, and ob≈øcure places, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the example of our Saviour, who delivered nothing in ≈øecret, ≈øave tho≈øe things which he had him≈øelfe ordained the Jewes for their wickedne≈ø≈øe ≈øhould not participate of, and that ≈øo the Scriptures might be fulfilled; but el≈øe how often is it ≈øaid, And he ≈øate down in the midde≈øt of the people and taught them? not in hou≈øes and corners. For my owne part, in tempory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and as concerning the execution of my duty, wherein I am intru≈øted; I dare any man Religious, to utter the wor≈øt he can of me; and for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lilburne,</hi> he in ≈øtandering me hath not detracted from my reputation, but ≈øinned again≈øt him≈øelfe.</q>
